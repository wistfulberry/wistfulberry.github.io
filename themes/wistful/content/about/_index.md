I am a Spanish professional in the fields of translation, writing and cross-cultural communication currently based in Beijing, where I work full-time as a Political Assistant for the Embassy of Spain to the People's Republic of China. In parallel with my main occupation, I also work part-time as a freelance translator for The World of Chinese and as a freelance lifestyle writer for The Beijinger. In my free time, I am also actively involved with a volunteer-run cultural and literary collective known as [**Spittoon International Arts Collective**](https://spittooncollective.com/), as a literary translator and a host for their Fiction Nights in Beijing. As a self-taught illustrator, I also produce most of the event posters for our Beijing chapter.

I graduated in Translation and Interpreting Studies from the University of Granada with Spanish, English and Chinese as my main working languages. I am qualified to take on a wide range of assignments, including legal translation and conference interpreting, though literary translation is perhaps my biggest passion. In this field, some of the most relevant accomplishment in my portfolio are the English translation of Chinese author Zhe Gui's novella 'Fleeing Xinhe Street' (Penguin Random House, 2019) and my extensive contribution to the English translation of "A General History of Chinese Arts", a series of academic volumes published by De Gruyter in 2023.

As a conference interpreter, my greatest accomplishment would undoubtedly be my simultaneous interpreting (Spanish-English) of the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, in his press conference at the Spanish Embassy during his official visit to China in March 2023.
